# Email-Phishing
Step 1: Obtain a Sample Phishing Email
•	Email Subject: COGNIZANT | Your Application has been processed
•	Sender Email: info@skill.getujobs.com
•	Date: 19 June 2025
•	Claim: Work-from-home opportunity at Cognizant
 
Step 2: Examine Sender’s Email Address
•	The email claims to be from Cognizant but uses @skill.getujobs.com — this is not an official Cognizant domain.
•	Red Flag: Fake or misleading domain name to spoof a known company.
Step 3: Check Email Headers
•	Not visible in the screenshot, but they should be reviewed using tools like:
o	Google Admin Toolbox
o	DNSCHECKER.ORG ,MXToolbox Email Header Analyzer
•	Look for:
o	SPF/DKIM failures
o	Return-path mismatches
o	IP geolocation anomalies
 
Step 4: Identify Suspicious Links or Attachments
•	The link "Apply Now!" is suspicious.
•	It likely redirects to a non-official job portal or credential-harvesting site.
•	Always hover (don't click) to verify where the link actually point.
Step 5: Look for Urgent or Attractive Language
•	Phrases like:
o	"Limited Openings"
o	"₹35,000 – ₹57,000/month"
•	These are designed to create urgency or excitement, pushing the user to act fast without verification.
Step 6: Note Any Mismatched URLs
•	No full URLs shown in the screenshot, but link anchor text (Apply Now!) is generic.
•	It likely does not match the displayed company name (Cognizant).
Step 7: Verify Grammar and Formatting
•	No major grammar errors, but:
o	Text is overly generic.
o	Layout mimics legitimate job emails — a common tactic.
Step 8: Summarize Traits Found
Trait	Observation
Sender mismatch	Not from official Cognizant domain
Link suspicion	Generic CTA (Call-to-Action) button
Urgency/lure	High salary, limited openings
Social engineering tactic	Preying on job seekers’ urgency and trust
Spam flag	Marked as spam due to similarity with past scams
